# Truncated-Differentials

The .py program will calculate T^r where T is a 2^{16} * 2^{16} matrix. 

The experimental results are stored in "Find_high_pro_cipherName_numberofRoundr.txt" files. In these files, the first two columns are the input truncated differential and output differential(both with decimal representation), and the last two columns are the truncated differential probabilities and the probabilities for random permutation.
